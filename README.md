# MBTI_Personality


# Intro
The Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a kind of psychological classification about humans experience using four principal psychological functions, sensation, intuition, feeling, and thinking.
In the MBTI personality jupyter notebook file, I used machine learning to evaluate the MBTIs validity and ability to predict language styles and behaviour online. Also included machine learning algorithm that can attempt to determine a person’s personality type based on some text they have written.

# Data
This dataset contains over 8600 rows of data, on each row is a person’s:
- Type (This persons 4 letter MBTI code/type)
- A section of each of the last 50 things they have posted (Each entry separated by "|||" (3 pipe characters))


# Classification types
The Myers Briggs Type Indicator (or MBTI for short) is a personality type system that divides everyone into 16 distinct personality types across 4 axis:
- Introversion (I) – Extroversion (E)
- Intuition (N) – Sensing (S)
- Thinking (T) – Feeling (F)
- Judging (J) – Perceiving (P)
